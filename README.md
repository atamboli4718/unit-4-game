## Overview
This project was created to practice my jQuery skills. jQuery is a JavaScript library created to simplify DOM manipulation and event handling. The syntax of jQuery allows us to write few lines of code to accomplish similar ends with vanilla JavaScript. Additionally, jQuery provides a number of methods for animations and working with APIs.

Many will argue that jQuery is slowly being phased out and replaced with front-end frameworks such as React. I I believe it is an important skill to master as the library is still widely used in both new and legacy code.
